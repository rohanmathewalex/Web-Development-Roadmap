    <!-- To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid, set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row.  -->

    <!-- Before diving into the concepts of Grid it’s important to understand the terminology. Since the terms involved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it’s easy to confuse them with one another if you don’t first memorize their meanings defined by the Grid specification. But don’t worry, there aren’t many of them. 
    
    Grid Container
    The element on which display: grid is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items. In this example container is the grid container.

    <div class="container">
        <div class="item item-1"> </div>
        <div class="item item-2"> </div>
        <div class="item item-3"> </div>
    </div>-->
